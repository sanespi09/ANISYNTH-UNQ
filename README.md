# ANISYNTH ðŸŽ›

Visual Sound Sintethizer made with Canvas, Web Audio API and P5.js Library.
It's a Work in Progress made for a research scholarship.  
Aims to be a more intuitive way of playing a sound sinthetizer,  
without the technical hassle.

## TEST IT YOURSELF
To make it run in your environment, you need to setup a local server (with a tool like [this](https://github.com/http-party/http-server))  
rooted in the proyect main folder.
